      	<h3>The Task</h3>

      	<p>The purpose of this task is to judge the eligibility of a patient to participate in a number of clinical trials. You will be asked to review a patient case report (called a patient query here). Then you will be presented with a number of clinical trials. For each trial, you should indicate if the patient meets the eligibility criteria for that trial. You are welcome to use external resources (Google, Wikipedia, WebMD, etc.) to lookup any information you like.</p>

      	<p>Please keep track of how long it takes you to judge each patient query. This information is used to record your hours but is also important for us in understanding how difficult this task is and whether certain patient and/or trials are harder than others.</p>

      	<p>Below are some basic instruction on using this system.</p>
        

		    <h3>Step 1: Select the Patient Queries</h3>

		    <ol>

		    <li>Select <em>Patient Queries</em> to begin. You will be presented with a list of queries as shown in Figure 1.</li>

		    <li>For each patient query, the total number of documents is displayed, as well as the number of documents that are still to be judged.</li>

		    <li>Click on a patient query to begin.</li>
		    </ol>

    		<h3>Step 2: View the documents for a patient query.</h3>

    		<ol>
		    <li>Once you select a patient you will be presented with the list of clinical trial documents (Figure 2).</li>

		    <li>For each document query, its status (Highly relevant, Somewhat relevant, Not relevant or Unjudged) is displayed.</li>

		    <li>Click on a document to judge it.</li>
		    </ol>

    		</div>

    		<h3>Step 3: Judge a clinical trial document.</h3>

    		<ol>
		    <li>Once you select a document you will be presented with the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the clinical trial (Figure 3).</li>

		    <li>Read the clinical trial (and re-read the patient query if need-be) and then make your assessment on the form provided. If you have any comment regarding your assessment then please provide this in the comments section.</li>

		    <li>Clicking <em>Save</em> will record your assessment; clicking <em>Save & Next</em> will save your assessment and bring up the next document in the list.</li>
